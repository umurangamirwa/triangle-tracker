##BDD.
1- if the sum of two sides is equal or less than the value of the third side, then the program will detect that the values do not form a definite triangle.
   
2- if the values entered are all equal to one another, then the program would show that an Equilateral triangle.
   
3-  if two values in the input are equal, third different, the program would show an iscoceles triangle.
    
4- if the values entered differ but don't exceed each other by much, triangle would be a Scalene triangle.
